# LEGODI 2.0

## APP

1.  Fork and Clone the repo.
2.  Make sure you go inside the app folder and then `yarn` or `npm install`.
3.  To run it use: `yarn start` / `npm start`

## Server

-To run the server, make sure you have strapi installed `npm install strapi@alpha -g` then `strapi start` from the _server_ folder


## Infrastructure

`staging` and `production` environments are hosted in the CYF kubernetes cluster ( `https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/kubernetes`).

The endpoints are:

`https://api.legodi.codeyourfuture.io`

`https://api.staging.legodi.codeyourfuture.io`

All the automation configuration can be found in `.circleci/config.yml`. Feel free to change and adapt to your needs (ex.: run tests before deployment, etc).

The container images are stored in docker hub under the `codeyourfuture` repository:

`https://hub.docker.com/r/codeyourfuture/legodi-api`


### What is docker-compose file do

It includes postgreSQL database image so if you do not have postgreSQL installed locally
this file will create one for you.

### How to use docker-compose file

To use this file you need first to install docker
then go to main directory of legodi then run: `docker-compose up`
for more details go to `https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview`

### Linting

StandardJs has been setup as a linter in both app and server.
To run it use `npm run lint` to run it with automatic fixing use this command `npm run lint -- --fix`

### Commitzen

git commitzen has setup as a git commit in both app and server.
Instead of using `git commit` you should use `git cz`
When you commit with Commitizen, you'll be prompted to fill out any required commit fields at commit time. No more waiting until later for a git commit hook to run and reject your commit (though that can still be helpful). No more digging through CONTRIBUTING.md to find what the preferred format is. Get instant feedback on your commit message formatting and be prompted for required fields.

### Testing

To run all the test use the command **npm test**

> to run a specific test **npm test theNameOfTheFile** for example _npm test mock-api_

## APP navigation

we've update the navigation function, we've created a helper file to reduce and simplify the code currentley there is two functions inside helper

1-GenerateNavigation
GenerateNavigation function created to reduce the code in MainTabNavigator and make it easy to use and unerstand
GenerateNavigation takes 5 parameters we can update it take more or less parameters

```js
const generateNavigation = (routeStack, label, color, iosIcon, androidIcon) => {
  routeStack.navigationOptions = {
    tabBarLabel: label,
    tabBarIcon: ({ focused }) => (
      <TabBarIcon
        focused={focused}
        color={color}
        name={
          Platform.OS === 'ios'
            ? `${iosIcon}${focused ? '' : '-outline'}`
            : androidIcon
        }
      />
    ),
  };
};
```

2- tabBarVisibility
We've created this function to hide the footer (tabBarVisibility) when we open Articles and Article page.
We can update this function to hide the footer from another screens just by the screen route name to the condition.

Control tab bar visibility at different screens

```js
export const tabBarVisibility = navigation => {
  let initialValue = true;
  navigation.state.routes.map(route => {
    const { routeName } = route;
    if (routeName === 'Article' || routeName === 'Articles') {
      return (initialValue = false);
    }
  });
  !initialValue ? { tabBarVisible: false } : null;
};
```

# Database

The first time you create the database, you will need to run these commands (three of them separately) in `postgres`

```sql
DROP ROLE IF EXISTS cyf;
```

```sql
CREATE USER cyf WITH PASSWORD 'password';
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE legodi OWNER cyf;
```

## Migrations

We use `knex` for migrations, but we created alias helpers on `package.json` to make it easier to run the commands.

[knex](https://knexjs.org/)

1.  Create a migration `npm run create-migration table_name`
2.  Create a seed `npm run create-seed table_name`
3.  To

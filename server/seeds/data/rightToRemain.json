        "full_content": "Your Legal Case\n\n\n  Even if you have a lawyer, it’s important to understand your own legal case – this is your case and your life and you need to keep track of what is happening and whether the lawyer is doing the things they should be. \n\n  Know your rights at different stages of the system, and know what the options are for the stage you are at. Knowing what could come next will help you prepare.\n\nTake an active role in your legal case. Don't passively accept the decisions of the Home Office and the courts if you think they are wrong. \n  Terminology - what is a lawyer?Legal aidExceptions in England and Wales\nRead the Public Law Project's guide to applying for exceptional funding without a lawyer here.\nLegal aid for detention mattersLegal aid for asylum supportLegal aid for judicial reviewMoving from Scotland/N Ireland to England/WalesLegal aid: time-limited and merits testedAlternatives to legal aidPrivate lawyerPro bono\n ACTION SECTION\n\nIf you are struggling to get a legal aid lawyer to take on your case, it may help to go through your case with a knowledgable friend/supporter and think about how to present it to a lawyer in the strongest possible way.  Getting evidence to back up your story may help with this.\nSimilarly, friends/supporters may be able to help you think about how to explain your case to a lawyer you are asking to take on your case pro bono.\nIf you cannot get a legal aid lawyer, supporters/your community could fundraise to pay for private legal fees.\n\nCommunicating with your lawyer\n\n  You should always have a copy of your documents, and anything your lawyer has submitted to the Home Office. Keep all your paperwork together in one organised file. \n  You should always know the last action your lawyer took: what they did, when, and when they expect a response.  \n  Your lawyer should speak to you before and after each stage in the process of applying for leave to remain (e.g. your Home Office interviews, the decisions on your case). \n  Make sure your lawyer knows your contact details. If you change address or phone number, let your lawyer know as soon as possible.\n  Contact your lawyer any time you receive a letter from the Home Office or from the Courts and Tribunals service. \n  Contact your lawyer prior to any appointments with the Home Office (other than routine reporting/signing events). \n\nFinding a lawyerA complaint against your lawyerLegal support (not legal advice)What is legal advice?Why you shouldn’t give legal advice if you are not a qualified adviser\n Providing legal support\nThere are many things that community/support groups can do to provide legal support without giving legal advice.  You can:\n\nprovide general legal information (you can use this Toolkit to do this)\nbefore somebody applies for asylum or immigration status, or while they are going through the process, sit down and go through the different stages and what can happen at each stage.  You may want to use our Toolkit, materials available online; or your own personal/professional experience.\nresearch evidence on a country of origin or particular situation of the person you are supporting\nuse your contacts to ask an expert to write a report to support the legal case\nhelp gather useful letters for the case – this might be from a school, Social Services, medical or mental health professionals, community groups\nread someone’s Reasons for Refusal Letter or court determination and point out which parts of their testimony are being doubted\nfind other case law or guidelines that these documents may refer to\nexplain the meaning of technical terms in legal documents\ntype up what someone wants to say in response to a Reasons for Refusal Letter, or other negative decision, especially if they find written English difficult\nhelp someone talk to their lawyer, if they are not comfortable doing this themselves\nhelp someone prepare for an asylum interview, asylum/human rights appeal, or judicial review hearing.  This may be by providing emotional support, practical information about where they have to go and how to get there, explaining the lay-out and personnel of the court, or listening to someone give their testimony so that the first time they do this is not in a hostile setting.\nhelp someone prepare in case they are detained, and agree a plan of action for if they are detained.\nvisit someone if they are detained\n\nYou will find more information about all of these actions as you go through the Toolkit.\n",

Some of the most common forms of visa are student visa, work visas and partner/spouse visas.  \nYou can find information about visas for the UK on the Home Office website.\nThe requirements for these visas are becoming increasingly difficult to meet: most require a lot of documentary evidence, large amounts of money, and lengthy probation periods. See also Family Migration section.\n    Student visasWork visasEuropean nationalsHealth surchargeEntering UK and claiming asylumFalse passports\nThere are legal options, even after a criminal sentence has been given, that may help you if you have been prosecuted for use of a false passport. One of these is the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC).\n\nThe CCRC was set up to deal with suspected miscarriages of justice.  It has reviewed a number of convictions relating to offences by asylum seekers/refugees connected to their entry to the UK. In most of these cases, the applicants have been advised to plead guilty, and were not advised that they may have a defence. The CCRC has the power to refer convictions (and sentences) to the appropriate appeal court if it determines there is a real possibility that the conviction will be quashed.\n\nFor more information on this process, contact the CCRC on 0121 233 1473 or get an application form on their website. \n  The CCRC can deal with cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

It is common, however, for human rights grounds to arise after an initial application for asylum. \n\n    Article 3Article 8Razgar Test\nThe Razgar test asks:\n\nwould someone's removal from the UK be an interference with their private or family life;\nwould this interference engage the operation of Article 8;\n\nwould the interference (removing the person from the UK) be in accordance with the law;\n\nwould the interference comply with the legitimate aim of a democratic society; \n\nand would such an interference be proportionate to the legitimate public end sought to be achieved by the public authority  (the Home Office)? \n\nArticle 8 and the immigration rulesMaking an article 8 applicationApplication FeeHealth surcharge\n ACTION SECTION\n\nAs you will see if you look at the fee waiver form, it is a long form to fill out!  Friends/supporter may be able to help with this, and with gathering the essential evidence to help your application be successful.\nIf a fee waiver is not granted, your supporters/community could help raise the money for the application/health surcharge. \nAfter reading this page, and the page on Rights of the child if relevant to your case, think about the evidence you need to gather.  Friends, supporters, your community can help gather this evidence and may even provide evidence in the form of statements/supporting letters.  \n\nArticle 8 and appeals\n\"In all cases based on Article 8, evidence of social, cultural, educational and other connections to the UK will be critical. Such evidence requires witnesses; current and former foster carers, friends from school, teachers, social workers, counsellors and anyone else who can vouch for the young man should be approached. Many young men are reluctant to do this because they do not like to ask favours, they are proud and they do not want to appear needy or vulnerable. This tendency must be resisted and overcome.\n\nIt is best if the witnesses can attend court. The more the merrier. More than 10 or 12 is probably excessive but it is helpful to convey in the strongest way possible that the young man is genuinely well regarded and integrated, to the point that many different people are willing to go out of their way and come to court to support him. Judges tend to be self important (it is virtually part of the job description) and attending court is the best, perhaps only, way anyone can show their respect to a judge. Written statements by those “unwilling” to attend in person are bound to be given less weight.\n\nWith considerable social and community support for a particular Appellant, perhaps combined with his having done very well at school or college (I have had the privilege to represent young Afghans who have qualified for university), there is a possibility that an appeal might succeed. Without that visible support, though, an appeal on private life human rights grounds is basically doomed to fail.\"\nLeave to remain based on Article 8",

In the  ACTION SECTIONS throughout this Toolkit, there are suggestions of actions that people around you can take, to help you get through the process.\n\nMost towns and cities in the UK to which asylum seekers are dispersed have community centres where you can meet other people seeking asylum, and volunteers who will be able to help and advise you. When you arrive in a new place, ask other people and look for these places, until you find one or more that you like.\nPrepare for what is coming next\nIf you have not yet had your asylum interview, start preparing for it now.\nMost people who apply for asylum are refused asylum by the Home Office. Make sure you know what your legal options are if this happens.\nYou may have the right to appeal the Home Office refusal of your asylum claim.  Is there evidence that you were not able to get in time for your asylum interview, but can get now?\nHave good people around you who can support you. It is not a nice experience to be told by the Home Office, and maybe by the courts as well, that you are not telling the truth.  With people standing by you in solidarity, you are more likely to be able to keep going, and keep fighting for justice in your case.\nFind out who your local MP is. \nYour MP will depend on the constituency you live in or have strong connections to. A constituency is an area of the UK where the voters elect one MP. \nYou can find out who your local MP is, and how to contact them, at TheyWorkForYou.com.\nIt’s never too early to start thinking about meeting your MP. If they already know you, they will be more likely to want to help if you go to speak to them when something has gone wrong in your case. It’s much more effective to meet them in person than to phone or email.  You can meet them during their \"surgery\" where they meet members of their constituency face-to-face to talk about local issues.  \nIf you're a member of a local group, you might like to invite your local MP to one of the group's events.  If you later approach the MP for help, your connection to that group may be a positive factor and may encourage them to help you.\n\n",

Is there someone you trust you can do a \"mock interview\" with?  Remember, if your friend/supporter is playing the part of the Home Office interviewer they should not be too friendly!\nAre there parts of your story that don’t make sense to them?  Is this because there are things you’ve forgotten to say? Or there things that don’t seem that important to you but are crucial to explaining the story to someone who wasn’t there?\nSome people find it useful to write down the important points of the story, or draw symbols and pictures, to get it straightened out in their head before they are asked questions in the interview (often in a confrontational way).  You will not be able to take these into the interview with you, however.\nYou may wish to write out, or tell a friend who will write it for you, a timeline of the events that took place leading up to you having to leave your country (this may cover many years). Discuss this with a friend, and it may prompt memories of important facts or details that you had forgotten.\nBe prepared, but in your interview try not to sound like you are repeating a script from memory or sound rehearsed, as this may sound like you are not telling the truth.\n\nMake sure you know where your interview will be (visit the place in advance of the interview), how you will get there and how long it will take to get there.  Being late or being lost will distract you from focusing on telling your story in the interview.\nBe prepared for not being believed: it is common for the Home Office interviewer to explicitly say they do not believe you, or make comments hinting as this.  You need to be very clear, give as much detail as possible, and try to remember to include all the important information.  Have friends, neighbours and supporters on hand to talk to before and after the interview.  \nThis is a crucial time for emotional support from those around you.\n\nAfter the interview\nSoon after the interview, perhaps the next day, you can go through the transcript to check for any mistakes or misunderstandings in your answers, or how they were written down, or in the interpretation. You might find it useful to have a friend/supporter to help you with this. It may be several months before you receive your asylum decision based on this interview, so it is best to look for potential problems while it is still fresh in your mind.\nYou can submit documentary evidence or statements explaining any issues that occurred during the interview to the Home Office within five days of your interview.\n",

Challenging these areas are more likely to succeed if you managed to submit a written statement to the Home Office about any problems during the interview before you received a refusal letter.  \nLook at your other documents to identify when the error has occurred.    These might include the record of an asylum screening interview, asylum interview, or any statements/evidence submitted to the Home Office. An asylum Reasons for Refusal Letter (RFRL) may reference the different documents with abbreviations:  Screening Interview (SCI), Asylum Interview Record (AIR), Witness Statement (WS).  \nHave all areas of your claim been considered?  If you are claiming asylum, has it been considered under the correct Refugee Convention grounds? \nIf you are applying under human rights grounds as well as claiming asylum, have these been considered properly in the decision letter?  For example, if you have claimed asylum and applied to stay under Article 8 (family and private life), has your Article 8 case been considered in the decision?\nYou can write a statement about the things you think are wrong with the refusal letter.   You can get a friend/supporter to help with this if you find writing in English difficult.  If you have a lawyer, they should write and submit this statement for you.  You should submit this statement to the Home Office and, if you have the right of appeal, to the court in advance of your appeal hearing. \nWhat evidence can you find to support your statement?

Sometimes it can be hard to think about anything else. But constant worry about your case can leave you feeling emotionally exhausted, and less able to cope with the process.\nEveryone has a different way of coping – think about what works for you. While your immigration status is of course very important, it’s also important to try and give yourself a break from thinking about it. Think about activities that can distract you or help you relax for at least a short period every day, which can help your mind and body recover a little. \nTalk to people you trust.  You may be very upset or even feel ashamed if your application/claim is refused, but don't hide it from people. You're going to need people to help you - don't be afraid to ask for their solidarity.  Don't leave it till it's too late for them to do anything.\nYou may wish to go and speak to your MP about your refusal, especially if you don't have the right to appeal. Think about how to explain what has happened clearly and calmly.  What has gone wrong? Why is the decision unjust? What do you want the MP to do about it? Read more here.\n\n\n",

In  asylum and immigration cases, that public body will usually be the Home Office.\nA judicial review can challenge the way a decision has been made, if you believe it was illegal, irrational, or unfair.

For example, gathering evidence to be submitted to be considered as a fresh claim is more easily phrased \"preparing a fresh claim\".\n    Legal test\nImmigration Rules\n353. When a human rights or asylum claim has been refused or withdrawn or treated as withdrawn under paragraph 333C of these Rules and any appeal relating to that claim is no longer pending, the decision maker will consider any further submissions and, if rejected, will then determine whether they amount to a fresh claim.\nThe submissions will amount to a fresh claim if they are significantly different from the material that has previously been considered.\nThe submissions will only be significantly different if the content:\n\n(i) had not already been considered; and \n\n(ii) taken together with the previously considered material, created a realistic prospect of success, notwithstanding its rejection. \nFresh claim outcomes\n1) The Home Office decides that your evidence meets the fresh claim criteria and that the new evidence shows you are in need of protection/meet human rights claim rules  you are granted refugee status; humanitarian protection; or other leave based on your human rights claim. \nOR\n2) The Home Office decides that your evidence meets the fresh claim criteria, they have considered your new claim, and have refused it: they have decided you are not in need of protection or leave to remain based on a human rights claim.  If this happens, you will be given the right to appeal the refusal of your claim.  This is a relatively positive outcome, as the court/Tribunal is more likely to look favourably on your evidence than the Home Office.\nThis outcome is what the phrase \"notwithstanding its rejection\" refers to in point (ii) of the fresh claim test above.  The Home Office decision-makers should be looking at whether the evidence submitted creates a \"realistic prospect of success\" first and therefore meets the fresh claim test even if they have decided the claim itself will not lead to a grant of protection/status.  It is this realistic prospect of success that generates the appeal right of the refusal.\nBefore making decisions 1 or 2, the Home Office may decide they need to interview you again.\nAlternatively, the Home Office will just make a decision based on the evidence you have submitted and write to you to tell you they have granted you leave to remain, or that you did meet the fresh claim test but they have refused your new claim.\nOR\n3) The Home Office decides that your new evidence does not meet the fresh claim legal test.  In these circumstances, you are not given the right of appeal.\nYour options may include exploring other legal options to regularising your immigration status; preparing a further, better fresh claim, or possibly a judicial review of the Home Office decision that your evidence doesn't meet the legal test.

        "full_content": "Detention\n\nIf you do not have the right to remain, you are liable to being held in immigration detention. This can happen at any time, but there are several points in the asylum and immigration process when you are more likely to be detained (see below).\nPeople detained under immigration powers may be detained in an immigration removal centre (IRC) or short-term holding facility, or if they are a foreign national ex-offender who has completed their custodial sentence they may continue to be detained in prison.\nWhen can you be detained?Who shouldn’t be detained, according to the Home Office’s own policy? \n\nsuffering from a mental health condition or impairment (this may include more serious learning difficulties, psychiatric illness or clinical depression, depending on the nature and seriousness of the condition)\nhaving been a victim of torture\nhaving been a victim of sexual or gender based violence, including female genital mutilation\nhaving been a victim of human trafficking or modern slavery\nsuffering from post traumatic stress disorder (which may or may not be related to one of the above experiences)\nbeing pregnant\nsuffering from a serious physical disability\nsuffering from other serious physical health conditions or illnesses\nbeing aged 70 or over\nbeing a transsexual or intersex person. \n\nBe prepared in case you are detained\n ACTION SECTION\nIf you are at risk of being detained, there are some things that you can and should do to be prepared.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou should have a list of emergency contacts, and someone else should have a copy. These might include your lawyer’s number (and your case reference number the lawyer uses in letters to you), any close friends or family, people you have spoken to about caring for children in case of detention, doctors or hospitals if you have a medical condition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave copies of your documents.  If you are detained, it may become impossible for you to access your documents if they are in your home. This means that vital evidence that a lawyer or a friend/supporter needs can’t be reached. You should have a copy of all your documents, not just your lawyer. Give a copy of these documents to someone you trust.  Scan and email yourself copies of your important legal documents, so that you can access them if you are detained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf possible, give a friend a copy of your house/room key. If you are detained, they can go and get essential things for you from your house. This may not be possible, for example if you are living in asylum accommodation. Only give a key to someone you trust, and make sure you are allowed to do this under your accommodation rules.  Alternatively, give a consent letter in advance to a friend giving permission to access your room in asylum accommodation if you are detained. This consent letter is also useful so that a friend can contact your lawyer on your behalf.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour phone will probably be taken off you when you are detained.  Keep your important numbers written down.  If it’s possible to still use your own sim card, it’s a good idea to have saved important numbers to the sim card beforehand (rather than to your phone handset) so the numbers will be still available in the replacement phone.  If you have a smart phone, the sim card is unlikely to work in the detention centre device.\nIf you are on medication, take this with you when you go to report/sign at the Home Office.  You should be able to keep this with you if you are detained, though you will be issued with new medication once you are detained.  Also take your prescription for the medication with you, and if possible, a letter from your doctor explaining why you need it and why it should not be restricted or changed.\n\n\nSigning support and detention action plans\nSome starters on setting up a signing/detention support system for your group:\n\n(1) Make sure you know when everyone in the group goes to sign\n(2) Where are people signing?\n(3) Where they will be detained locally, before they are sent to a longer-term detention centre?\n(4) Have basic information about the stage that group members' cases are at. Remember, you don’t need to know everything about someone’s case, and you should only ask for information if the person is comfortable sharing it.\n(5) It may help to have a basic form that you use with information on such as name, date of birth, emergency contact details including lawyer if there is one, family, health problems etc. Their Home Office reference number may be important for contacting the lawyer/the Home Office. On this form, you can indicate issues that need to be thought about if someone is detained – are there children who need emergency child-care? Is medication needed?\n(6) Create a simple consent form for every group member to sign, giving permission for the group (or a named representative of the group) to speak to the person’s lawyer, or MP, or to enter their asylum accommodation, for example.\n(7) How does the group find out that somebody’s been detained? You might want to think about a buddy system (with back-up in case the buddy is away), a telephone tree or email system.\n\nHave an action planLegal options in detentionLegal aid contracted firmsDetention far from where you live\n ACTION SECTION\nIf you are unable to get legal advice from one of the contracted firms in immigration detention, you could think about these alternatives:\n\npro bono legal advice. Read more here.\nsupporters/friends providing legal support that does not involve giving legal advice. Read more here. \nfundraise for a private solicitor\n\nIf you are detainedCommunicationChaplains/religious support\n ACTION SECTION: visiting\n\nFriends and family can visit you in detention.\nThey will need to find out the visiting times, notify the centre in advance (they may need to give 24 hours’ notice) and bring ID with them. They can ring the detention centre to find out what form of ID they will need. They will have their photograph taken at the centre, and their fingerprints may be scanned as well. See the Home Office website for details of visiting each detention centre.\n\nThere are also visitor groups (co-ordinated groups of people, usually volunteers, who regularly visit people in detention to provide company and emotional support) set up for each detention centres and some prisons. The Association of Visitors to Immigration Detainees (AVID) has a list of their members on its website.\n\nIf someone you know has been detained, you might want to arrange visits to see them. The isolation of detention can make it very difficult to keep your spirits up.  Keeping engaged and communicating is essential not just for wellbeing but also for continuing with the legal process.\nIf a member of your group has been detained, you might want to think about fundraising to pay travel costs so group members can visit the person in detention. Detention centres are often difficult to reach by public transport, so sharing lifts in a car/petrol costs may be the easiest way of visiting.\nSome groups also organise letter writing sessions, where everyone gets together to write to someone they know (or even someone they don't) in detention. If a member of your group has been detained, you might want to take photos of the group getting together to take this action and send the photos to the person in detention, so they know people are thinking about them.\n\n\nGetting out of detentionImmigration bail\nIf you cannot find a lawyer to help you with these applications, you can apply for bail yourself. Bail Immigration for Detainees (BID)  have produced a handbook which can help with this.\nAddressesFinancial condition supporters\nThe Immigration Bail Observation Project Scotland has produced a useful leaflet and guide about being a cautioner, the bail procedure and providing bail addresses.  While written for people supporting those in Scotland, the information is also useful for those supporting someone trying to get immigration bail elsewhere in the UK too.\nBail hearings\n\nDrawing of a video-link bail hearing.

A judge in court may not agree.  \nThe Home Office cannot dictate in the immigration rules exactly what Article 8 means and what would be a disproportionate breach for every case. A judge may find that even if you don't meet the requirements of the immigration rules, you would suffer a disproportionate breach of your Article 8 rights if you were deported.\nSee below for legal challenges to deportations.\nAppealing the decision to deport youAsylum or human rights claimJudicial review\n ACTION SECTION\n\nAirline campaigning\nThis is a last-minute action that may be possible if someone has been issued with a \"courtesy letter\" that gives details of the removal/deportation flight.\nTaking action for the right to remain cannot just be about stopping a flight – if contacting the airline successfully stops the flight, this may buy some time for other actions to be taken and for legal avenues to be pursued.\nYour supporters can contact the airline, explain you are being taken against your will and why you should not be taken from the UK, and ask the airline not to accept you on the flight. \nRead more here.\nContact your MP\nThis action is more likely to succeed if you are already in contact with your MP about your case.
